Tips from experience:
- Lines tend to be inaccurate when it comes to odometry but is direct.
- Splines are ultra smooth but tend to do stupid things.
- Trajectory sequence just better.
- The endTangent is the same as ending heading.
- Don't bother with using UNSTABLE commands.
- Falling-command rule: non-temporal markers and waits are executed in groups up to the next
movement command. Waits are prioritized. In other words NEVER chain a marker and a wait.
- Coordinates: Uses standard odometry coordinates, where the field center is (0, 0).
Going "forwards" in our perspective is -y direction.
- Don't add displacement markers at the very end. It won't work.
- To ignore the traj.end(pos) condition:
-- set pos = getPoseEstimate (may not work)
-- use relative from (0, 0) position using setPoseEstimate(0, 0) first
