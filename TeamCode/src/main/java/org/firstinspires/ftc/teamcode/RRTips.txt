Tips from experience:
- Lines tend to be inaccurate when it comes to odometry but is direct.
- Splines are ultra smooth but tend to do stupid things.
-- DO NOT combine moving backwards with splineTo bc you need splineToLinear or Constant.
-- Only combining splineTo and splineToLinear works for continuous motion profiles.
Moving backwards also splits motion profiles.
-- If you try to use splineToConstant with a new angle it won't turn to the new angle.
- Trajectory sequence just better.
- The endTangent is the same as ending heading.
- Don't bother with using UNSTABLE commands.
- Falling-command rule: non-temporal markers and waits are executed in groups up to the next
movement command. Waits are prioritized. In other words NEVER chain a marker and a wait.
- Don't add displacement markers at the very end. It won't work.
- To ignore the traj.end(pos) condition:
-- set pos = getPoseEstimate (may not work)
-- use relative from (0, 0) position using setPoseEstimate(0, 0) first
